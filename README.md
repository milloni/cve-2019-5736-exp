# cve-2019-5736-exp

This is a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for the CVE-2019-5736 vulnerability in
runc, the runtime used in Docker.

## Disclaimer

I undertook this project as an exercise, for educational reasons and for fun.
It should go without saying that I do not support unethical and/or illegal
misuse of this code.

## Description

The vulnerability was discovered by [Adam Iwaniuk] and [Borys Popławski] and
described in this [blog post][ds]. Thanks for the great research!

## Usage

To build a malicious container:

```
docker build .
```

Running this container will cause the runc binary to be overwritten with the
contents of the `payload` file, i.e.

```
docker run <image_id>
```

Next time runc is executed (e.g when a different container is run), the host
will execute your payload.
